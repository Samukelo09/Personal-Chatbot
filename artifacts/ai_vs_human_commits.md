# AI vs Human Contributions

Ubundi asked to "show your thinking."  
Here’s a breakdown of what I did manually vs with AI assistance.

---

### AI-Assisted
- **Boilerplate code generation**: Streamlit input widgets, LangChain Ollama integration.
- **Debugging help**: fixing `st.text_input` height bug, session state issues.
- **Prompt wording suggestions**: adding structure with STYLE, CONTEXT, QUESTION.

### Human-Directed
- **Knowledge base creation**: writing my own `.md` stories (Ndishi Boys, Izimpisi, Funny Secret, Final Year, Honours, Personal Life).
- **Project architecture**: decision to use FAISS + local embeddings + Ollama (instead of paid APIs).
- **UI design**: modes in sidebar, rebuild index button, transcript export.
- **Refinements**: file auto-rebuild logic, copy-buffer, regenerate answer.

### Reflection
AI was a coding assistant; the **content** (my experiences, challenges, stories) and the **design vision** (personal Codex Agent for interviews) were mine.  
This collaboration demonstrates how I’d work with AI tools on the job: **pair-programming with AI, steering it with my own domain knowledge**.
