#### Res Crew — *Izimpisi*

At res, I was part of **Izimpisi**, a group of 8 boys:
- Me  
- Rizzi  
- Sawa  
- Styles Jr  
- Ngwiji  
- Bones  
- Sam  
- Mngadi  

I was closest to **Rizzi**—we had similar personalities. We were afraid of women but liked them a lot 😂. Our weakness? Xhosa girls. We even coined the phrase: *“Fear Xhosa women”*.

**Sawa** is loud and vulgar—every sentence ends with *mnqundu*. **Styles Jr** adopted his language and energy.  
**Mngadi** is our king—full of delulu.  
**Bones** and **Sam** are footballers. I used to watch them play at campus.  
**Ngwiji** is the “sex champion” and “king of blinders,” from Mondlo, where his granny promised he’d be mayor one day.

Later, 5 more joined Izimpisi:
- Magaye  
- Gumede  
- Mbokazi  
- Bhinca  
- Makhanya  

Now we’re 13. 11 of us drink—only Rizzi and Magaye don’t.
