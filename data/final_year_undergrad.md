### Challenges

The most unforgettable moment was the COMP315 group project. Our team (RALLSMOH), led by Mhlongo, had to build a quiz game in C++. We didn‚Äôt follow the rubric properly, and during the presentation, our lecturer Yuvika told us we were ‚Äúterrible programmers‚Äù and threatened to give us 4/100.

That project counted for 50% of the class mark, and I needed at least 7% to qualify for the exam. I was devastated‚Äîwent back to res and drank half a bottle of Ballantine‚Äôs whiskey out of stress, thinking I‚Äôd have to repeat the module and be classmates with students I was tutoring.

Fast forward: she gave us 45%. I qualified for the exam. After all that stress üò≠üò≠
