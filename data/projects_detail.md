# Project Details

## Machine Translation (IsiZulu-English/English-IsiZulu)
- **Objective**: Build neural machine translation for IsiZulu-English language pairs
- **Technical Stack**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, SentencePiece, spaCy
- **Approach**: Fine-tuned pre-trained models on parallel corpus with custom preprocessing pipelines
- **Challenges**: Handling low-resource language constraints and morphological complexity
- **Achievements**: Developed working prototype capable of basic phrase translation

## Coin Recognition System
- **Objective**: Computer vision system for identifying South African coins
- **Technical Stack**: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Approach**: Implemented CNN architecture for image classification with data augmentation
- **Results**: Achieved 83% recognition accuracy on test dataset
- **Applications**: Potential for vending machines or banking applications

## Cloud Computing Ontology
- **Objective**: Create semantic ontology for cloud resource discovery
- **Technical Stack**: OWL 2 DL, Protégé, Description Logic, RDF/XML
- **Approach**: Modeled cloud services, resources, and their relationships semantically
- **Impact**: Enhanced interoperability and automated resource discovery capabilities
