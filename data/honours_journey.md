# Honours Journey

I was admitted to the **BSc Honours in Computer Science** programme at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in 2025.  
This was always my dream after completing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science & IT (2024).  

I’m funded by the **NRF bursary**, which gives me peace of mind to focus fully on my studies and research.

## Coursework

- **COMP700: Research Project**  
  My research is titled *“Water Pipeline Leak Prediction Using Deep Learning”* under the supervision of **Okuthe Paul Kogeda**.  
  The project focuses on predicting water pipeline leakage in eThekwini using historical leakage data.  
  - Data source: Umgeni Water (contact already established).  
  - Methodology: literature review, simulation & modelling, implementation.  
  - Tools: Python (deep learning frameworks).  
  - Expected outcome: a water pipeline leak prediction model.

- **COMP718: Contemporary Topics in Computer Science B (Quantum Computing)**  
  Explores quantum computing principles, algorithms, and emerging applications.

- **COMP717: Contemporary Topics in Computer Science A (Internet of Things)**  
  Focuses on IoT technologies, design, and their role in modern systems.

- **COMP720: Mini-Project**  
  Topic: *Deep Learning for Ontology Axioms Construction from Texts*.  
  Explores how deep learning can be applied to automate ontology building from natural language.

- **COMP702: Coin Recognition**
  This project aims to identify and classify South African bank coins using an automated pipeline that is invariant to coin side, scale, and rotation. The pipeline includes preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification using both classical machine learning and deep learning (CNNs).

- **COMP703: Machine Translation**
  This project implements a neural machine translation (NMT) pipeline for Xhosa-to-English translation using sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models in PyTorch. Both a baseline LSTM encoder-decoder and an attention-based architecture are developed and evaluated, with comparisons to a pretrained multilingual transformer model (M2M100).

## Goals

- To deepen my expertise in **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and IoT**.  
- To complete my research project successfully and publish my findings.  
- To prepare myself for either a **Masters journey** or a strong industry role in **AI/Software Engineering**.

## Reflection

Being admitted to honours was one of my proudest academic milestones.  
I had even applied for jobs as a backup, but this programme was always my top priority.  
I see it as the perfect stepping stone toward contributing impactful research and advancing my career.
