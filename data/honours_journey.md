# Honours Journey

I was admitted to the **BSc Honours in Computer Science** programme at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in 2025.  
This was always my dream after completing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science & IT (2024).  

I’m funded by the **NRF bursary**, which gives me peace of mind to focus fully on my studies and research.

## Coursework

- **COMP700: Research Project**  
  My research is titled *“Water Pipeline Leak Prediction Using Deep Learning”* under the supervision of **Okuthe Paul Kogeda**.  
  The project focuses on predicting water pipeline leakage in eThekwini using historical leakage data.  
  - Data source: Umgeni Water (contact already established).  
  - Methodology: literature review, simulation & modelling, implementation.  
  - Tools: Python (deep learning frameworks).  
  - Expected outcome: a water pipeline leak prediction model.

- **COMP718: Contemporary Topics in Computer Science B (Quantum Computing)**  
  Explores quantum computing principles, algorithms, and emerging applications.

- **COMP717: Contemporary Topics in Computer Science A (Internet of Things)**  
  Focuses on IoT technologies, design, and their role in modern systems.

- **COMP720: Mini-Project**  
  Topic: *Deep Learning for Ontology Axioms Construction from Texts*.  
  Explores how deep learning can be applied to automate ontology building from natural language.
