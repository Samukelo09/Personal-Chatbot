### Funny Secret

My coping mechanism during that time was Ballantine’s whiskey. People saw me carrying a water bottle with “juice”—but it was actually whiskey mixed with Monster energy drink. I called it *isikhuthazi* (my motivator). If anyone asked what was in the bottle, I’d say *isikhuthazi*. If they asked about my study habits, I’d say *isikhuthazi*.

I stopped using alcohol as a coping mechanism in May this year. I still drink occasionally, but not to study.
