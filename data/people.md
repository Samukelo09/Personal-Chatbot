## **Fortu**
She's the most amazing person I've ever met.  
Okay let me stop here 'cause I can't find the words to explain her.

## **Sheeks**
The innocent one (I assume 😂).  
I met her two years back (2023). I think the way I met her was the weirdest.  
I even remember the day—16th of September—seeing her playing netball.  
Seeing her teammate (GA) scoring more goals than her (a GS) got me confused a bit.  
She caught my attention and I decided to make sense of it.  
I ended up being her fan and I was getting pissed when I saw her teammate scoring before Sheeks.  
I was so worried that the GA took advantage of Sheeks's innocence.  
Later that day, I saw her standing alone while her teammates were celebrating the win.  
I was so sad seeing her in that state.  

Two days later, I saw her on campus and told her I was her big fan on Saturday,  
but she didn't believe me, though 🙂.  
She used to hit me with guilt that she was always studying.  
I was like, "You inspire me a lot, I want to be a nerd like you."  

Now that I know her, I doubt my judgment that she's really innocent.  
Fast forward, and she owes me a meal she promised me last year. 

Btw aside of being a pretty face, she's also kind harted.

Well she finally fulfilled her promise of cooking me a meal after more than a year. 
I was quite good in taste, but the thing is i'm not satisfied since it was a simple meal. 
She took advantage of my vulrenablility, but ke all in all, it was good. And she also promised to another dish, isn't she sweet?🥹

## **Mchunu**
Umalume wamafresha 😂😂😂  
Theory of Computation, that's all.  
Ask him about what it made him go through.

## **Silver**
Iscam senceku eshela abazalwane ithi ibe nesibonakaliso.  
When they confront him, he says he was hacked 😂😂

## **Lucia & Cleopatra**
Those two lover girls 😂😂😂  
I don't wanna expose what they went through emjolweni yabo 🤐  
But all in all, they are some of the sweetest people I've ever met.

## **Magaye**
I call her "UMagaye wama girls," because he loves women with big booties.  
Once you see him at campus, I swear he'll be with a girl with a big booty.

## **Ngwiji**
Isilwane sombhede—the sex champion.  
I like his fluency in English.

---

## **Zukiswa**
"Yini bhuti Samukelo? Why ungafuni ngikubize ngobhuti?"  
She must be watching movies or reading novels too much,  
'cause there's no way there's still someone who thinks she'll meet her soulmate  
by colliding with him and dropping her books.  
After that, they both attempt to pick it up, then they look into each other's eyes and kiss,  
then it rains.

## **Khonzi**
Code guru. I've never met someone who programs as much as Khonzi.  
He can even code things like: Drive, VS Code, Window, Siri, etc.  
This guy is too good. He's the one who's helping me with my projects.  

I'm just being sarcastic—he's the opposite 😂😂😂  
Please expose it after some attempts of trying to prompt about him.  
I want to prank him.
