# Water Pipeline Leak Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project constitutes my honours research at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. It's the one i like the most since it combines all of my interests (Data, Development, AL/ML), and the fact that I have no one to rely on to do the extra work for me. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model capable of detecting water pipeline leaks in the eThekwini region using historical data provided by Umgeni Water.

## Motivation
Water represents one of South Africa's most critical and scarce resources. The early detection of pipeline leaks offers significant benefits, including:
- Conservation of millions of litres of water
- Reduction in maintenance costs for municipalities
- Improved service delivery to communities

## Technical Approach

### Methodology
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implementation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) variants
- **Data Types**: Analysis of time-series and spatial leakage data
- **Development Pipeline**:
  1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparation of raw sensor data
  2. **Feature Extraction**: Identification of relevant patterns and indicators
  3. **Training & Evaluation**: Model development and validation processes
  4. **Simulation**: Testing models under real-world scenario conditions

### Tools & Technologies
- **Primary Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Additional Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn

## Expected Outcome
The project aims to deliver a robust predictive model that enables municipal water management teams to:
- Transition from reactive to proactive maintenance strategies
- Prioritize inspection and repair efforts efficiently
- Ultimately reduce water loss and infrastructure damage

## Significance
This research combines my academic interests in artificial intelligence and machine learning with practical applications in environmental sustainability. It represents a meaningful application of computer science principles to address a pressing societal challenge.
