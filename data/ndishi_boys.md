#### Campus Crew â€” *Ndishi Boys*

I was mostly with **Gagashe**, my classmate in both majors. We were both aiming for honours admission and vented to each other after bad marks. We both got in.

**Zolile** (who hates programming ðŸ’€) became our close friend. She followed us around and eventually joined our circle.

**Ndishi** was our group leader for Applied Systems Implementation. He was doing Economics & IT and is now in Information Systems Honours. Heâ€™s super protective of Zolileâ€”like an older brother.

The three of us (me, Gagashe, Ndishi) formed the **Ndishi Boys**. We even have a WhatsApp group. Zolile is our honorary sister. We boycotted the graduation ceremony in May, planning to attend next year for honours. Zolile wasnâ€™t happy about that. Sheâ€™s currently finishing her final-year CS modules.
