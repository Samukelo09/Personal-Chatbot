## My Approach to Learning and Teamwork

I believe the most valuable skill in technology is the ability to learn continuously and adapt quickly. My approach to complex problems is methodical:

1.  **Deconstruct:** Break down problems into smaller, manageable components.
2.  **Research:** Investigate underlying concepts and potential solutions.
3.  **Experiment:** Build, test, and iterate until I achieve clarity.

To me, debugging is not just about fixing errors—it's a fundamental process for understanding how systems operate and interact.

My experience as a tutor for undergrads computer science students has shown me how collaboration accelerates growth. I deeply value teams where members are:

-   **Open-minded** and receptive to new ideas.
-   **Proactive** in sharing knowledge and expertise.
-   **Committed** to building each other up and achieving shared goals.

I thrive in environments where challenges are viewed as opportunities to innovate and grow, not as roadblocks.

I am deeply passionate about **AI**, **cybersecurity**, and **IoT**—fields defined by rapid evolution that demand constant curiosity. What excites me most is leveraging technology not only to solve technical problems but to create meaningful, positive impact in people's lives.
